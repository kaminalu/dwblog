This blog was created for Dr. Karl Stolley's Fall, 2016 COM 201 Digital Writing course at the Illinois Institute of Techonology. It is solely intended for the purpose of publishing assignments completed for this course, and is in no way a limitation of the work I have produced throughout my educational and professional career.
