title: Digital Literacy Narrative - Second Draft
---

In 1998, when I was 13 or 14 years old, I created my first email address: goddessaphrodite84@gURL.com. Yes, probably the most ridiculous handle anyone has ever heard (I can hear laughing through time and space), but I was barely a teenager and my friends and I were obsessed with boys. Embarrassingly, we would also frequent Yahoo! chatrooms looking for boyfriends overseas. One time I became penpals with a teenage boy from Liverpool and I swear I spent days thinking of ways I could insert uniquely American words and spellings into emailed conversations. For example, elevators instead of lifts and tires instead of tyres. Such. A. Dork.

Anyway, this was way before the internet was used for everyday purposes including communication or as a reliable information source, and even my parents did not have their own email accounts.  It was a bit like installing Snapchat today: most parents kind of knew what the internet was, but not really how to use it.

In those days, my hosting, gURL.com, was a lot like a 'zine had a baby with the World Wide Web. And I say it like that exactly because of how it appeared and operated: like something made when the term "World Wide Web" was still widely used. It was difficult to read, loosely organized, non-responsive, and animated-gif-heavy.  But it was an awesome home for teenage girls trying out the internet for the first time. Like a teen magazine, gURL.com walked young women through relationships, style advice, school, entertainment, and female physiology. However, unlike other teen 'zines, it also gave young women a place to learn how to create and publish their own web pages.

Using their interface, someone with no experience in programming languages could develop and design a site piece by piece. It was pretty limited to HTML markup and so I started to learn the basics of the new language in an effort to build my very own webpage for the internet. To me, this was the coolest thing in the world, and I happily gave out my web address to all of my friends. At the time, it was nothing more than a personal diary, or what we consider these days a “blog,” but it was my own little space on the web.

The specifics of what my website contained have mostly been lost to time and memory. However, there are a few bits and pieces that I can still recall. I remember I had a page that contained creatively written accounts of dreams I found memorable. Another page had several poems that I had written, and to this day, I can only remember one line:

>The butcher isn't really butch
>but everybody's acting.

So strange. There were also -- of course -- some animated gifs sprinkled throughout the site, a page hit counter and at least one page that just said "UNDER CONSTRUCTION." Ultimately, I think the idea was to have some kind of creative outlet in a place that I felt was safe from parental scrutiny, as well as my own connection to the potential-filled world that existed outside of my small hometown.  My web pages became a small piece of me in the ocean that is the internet.

The HTML was something else that was lost to time. I remember only vaguely understanding the importance of tags and formatting. Tags like <b> and <i> were used extensively as well as some tags pointing to other URLs, but I don't recall much beyond that.  gURL.com offered as a resource some templates, tutorials, and today what we would call "spec" on HTML markup that really helped me to understand how to accomplish what I was trying to do on each page.

Shortly after I met my first real boyfriend the summer before my freshman year of high school, I allowed my pages to languish and ultimately become lost to the void of the internet. I no longer used my markup skills and eventually, all but the above was forgotten. However, I know that this small experience with markup as a teenager was certainly one of the most helpful experiences I could have had as I came into my first web development class at Illinois Tech.

Now, as an adult, I’m am relearning what it feels like to write for the internet and build a space for myself among the billions of web pages that exist. My latest attempt has me using Jekyll, a static site generator that will allow me to build a blog using only the simplest of markdown text. While HTML still has immense usefulness (I built my professional website using it with CSS last semester), markdown with Jekyll is faster and more intuitive when creating a simple layout like a blog.

While I can honestly say that this new experience resembles my old experiences with gURL.com in a couple of ways -- namely the text input interface and general layout of my current blog made with Jekyll -- there are several other things that I struggled with and am still learning.

To date, the biggest struggle in getting Jekyll to work was merely using my Terminal in Linux to complete the installation of Ruby and Rails. (MORE DETAIL HERE) 

Once that was done, I was able to install the Jekyll gem and create a new repository on github for my new blog for this class under “dwblog.” Writing new posts from there has been relatively easy, as all it required was reviewing the sample post the Jekyll dev team built, copying it with my own info and text within gedit, and pushing it to github. 

(A BIT MORE ABOUT LEARNING MARKDOWN)

I do, however, foresee some further difficulty when I plan to implement a theme to my blog. Preliminary research has shown that I will need to do quite a bit of copying, deleting, downloading, pushing, and pulling of files, among probably other things. The prospect of what seems like should be a simple task has me a little worried, but I’m sure it will all look great in the end.
