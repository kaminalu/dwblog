Music has a very special quality. Like other sources of sensory information, a certain song can represent something different to each individual.  It can cause almost involuntarily recall.

There are some songs in my life that bring back a person, a place, a time or even a feeling with such perfect clarity, a shiver runs across my body or my eyes well up with tears.  These are some of those songs.

SONG - ARTIST 
(ALBUM | YEAR)

Hyperballad - Bjork 
(Post | 1996)
At one time in my life, the idea of leaping off the side of a mountain into empty space felt romantic.

Sweetest Kill - Broken Social Scene 
(Forgiveness Rock Record | 2010)
I listened to this song on a jukebox in an empty bar on my 29th birthday.  It felt warm and inviting, like I was melting.

Stand By Me - Ben E. King
(Don’t Play That Song! | 1960)
I will never feel more at home, than when I hear this song.

The Purple Bottle - Animal Collective
(Feels | 2005)
Sometimes I feel like I’m in love.  I might be crazy.

Infra 5 - Max Richter
(Infra | 2010)
This one plays when it rains.

Monument - Mirah
(Advisory Committee | 2002)
My mind: “I’m lost.”
My heart: “Trust me.”

New Kicks - Le Tigre
(This Island | 2004)
Once I marched against the Iraq War.  Once I fought and campaigned for Hope.  A fire somewhere burns within me.

Birdie Brain - The Fiery Furnaces
(Blueberry Boat | 2004)
Lazily listening on boundless bus mornings down the lake shore.

Black Coffee - Peggy Lee
(Black Coffee | 1953)
At my first job I fed greasy food to sloppy people. I cleaned and smiled, but inside I sighed and moaned along with Peggy Lee.

Get Me Away From Here, I’m Dying - Belle & Sebastian
(If You’re Feeling Sinister | 1996)
My late teenage anthem.  My uptempo downer personality.

Serpentine - Chris Bathgate
(A Cork Tale Wake | 2006)
A friend of a friend of an ex-boyfriend pushing words through his teeth. I can hear my own sad struggles in his sounds.

Blue Chicago Moon - Songs: Ohia
(Didn’t It Rain | 2002)
When I was 19 years old, my family hospitalized me for severe depression. Listening to this album felt like a hug, like someone understood me.

(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction - Cat Power
(The Covers Record | 2000)
<rant>A cover song is not supposed to sound exactly like the original, people. Take the idea and make it your own. Otherwise it’s just a sad derivative void of artistic merit.</rant>

No Comprende - Low
(Ones and Sixes | 2015)
Low has a way of making a hole in my heart and filling it back up with care.  I’ve listened to them through some very hard times, and always the same flood of emotion returns.

I Believe in Immediacy - Black Bear
(The Cinnamon Phase | 2006)
I love words.  I love the poetry of words in music.  I love how sounds in words and music come together in infinite ways to make some really special things for people.
