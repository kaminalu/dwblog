title: Reflective Social Presence - Part II
---

Since my last update, I've had a chance to delve a bit deeper into the features of Snapchat.  One of the first thing I noticed were the Friend Emojis that discreetly tell you how friendly you are with other people on the service.  For example, the "Their BF, but..." emoji appears next to my sister's username indicating that the app considers me one of her best friends, but she is not one of mine.

This puzzles me, as I was never given the option to choose if she was my best friend or not.  Naturally, I immediately searched for a way to add her, but could not find a way.  This made me think that Snapchat somehow analyzes how often or when you send snaps to friends and automatically assigns those interactions a value.  Since I do not send many snaps in general, it must assume that my sister is not one of my closest friends.  The fact that I don't have any friendly emojis present next to other usernames furthers this point.

Digging around some more led me to Snapchat's Permissions page.  This one was interesting, as it seemed much longer than most app permissions pages, like Instagram which doesn't have one at all.  Most options were pretty standard though, like "Take pictures and videos" and "Read your contacts." However, I was pretty confused at first by the two options "Modify or delete the contents of your USB storage" and "Read the contents of your USB storage."  After all, I had never heard of a phone's memory referred to as USB storage.  Was this intentional on the part of Snapchat?  Why didn't they just say "device storage" like most apps do?  Interesting.

Another interesting page I came across was the Ad Preferences.  This was probably the most baffling of all, in that it is an auto-checked option that automatically "customizes the ads you see based on the information from our ad partners" and "if you turn off this feature, you'll still see ads based on your identity details and activity on Snapchat, but not based on information from ad partners."  

What?  Are they saying that
