title: Reflective Social Presence - Part II

Since my last update, I've had a chance to delve a bit deeper into the features of Snapchat.  One of the first thing I noticed were the Friend Emojis that discreetly tell you how friendly you are with other people on the service.  For example, the "Their BF, but..." emoji appears next to my sister's username indicating that the app considers me one of her best friends, but she is not one of mine.

This puzzles me, as I was never given the option to choose if she was my best friend or not.  Naturally, I immediately searched for a way to add her, but could not find a way.  This made me think that Snapchat somehow analyzes how often or when you send snaps to friends and automatically assigns those interactions a value.  Since I do not send many snaps in general, it must assume that my sister is not one of my closest friends.  The fact that I don't have any friendly emojis present next to other usernames furthers this point.
