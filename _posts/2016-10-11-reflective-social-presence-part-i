title: Reflective Social Presence - Part I
---

Social media is the worst.  There, I said it.  I absolutely loathe the shallowness of connection, the fake front, the meaningless convention, and everything in between.  I do not have a Facebook or Twitter account, and the besides the (mostly defunct) MySpace and Google+, the last profile I updated was on LinkedIn, a place where I only feel depressed that I haven’t really done anything with my professional life yet.  Other than that, there is only one “social” app I use daily, which I will describe in a moment.

Ultimately, however, when tasked with an assignment to join and blog about a new social media platform in contrast to one I already use, I was a bit frustrated, anxious, and generally unhappy.  I did not want to place myself further into the realm of those pathetically desperate for attention.  Yes, it would be a challenge, for sure, but not one I would enjoy taking on.

It had to be done, and so let me begin by saying: I'm a visual person.  I love to learn by watching, and over the years I’ve learned that I respond best to visual stimuli.  I like art, television, theater, and film.  I like open expanses and intricate details.  I like pattern and style, trompe l'oeil and abstraction.  Visual cues challenge me and help me to develop ponderous thoughts, thunderous rage, and uncontrollable happiness. 

This is why my only favorite "social media"  app is Instagram.  Instagram provides a steady stream of photos and video from personally approved sources - a neverending stream of visual content if you will. Its user interface minimalist, intuitive, and straightforward.  I have never had an ounce of difficulty navigating the app’s features.  And to date, I have posted over 100 photos, and follow only a handful of people -- mostly my close friends and family, and some creative women who inspire and delight me.

However, in order to fulfill the assignment -- and to placate my sister who has been bothering me about it for months -- I joined something new.  Given my affinity for visual communication, I decided to become a user of Snapchat.  And (spoiler alert!) I hate it.

Let me explain…

Snapchat has one of the most confusing app interfaces I have ever encountered.  On the very first screen there are so many buttons that don’t make any sense and were completely unintuitive, other than maybe the big circle in the bottom center which I (rightly) assumed was for taking a photo.  Note that an update seems to have labeled the bottom left and right buttons as “Chat” and “Stories,” but that those were not visible when I first installed the app.

Choosing “Stories” brings me to a page with a bunch of garbage on it that I guess Snapchat thinks I’d be interested in…?  Most apps will ask what my interests are before slopping a bunch of promotional junk at me, but not Snapchat.  Apparently, I am now someone who wants to look at pictures of rock climbing and NFL games.

Scrolling underneath all of the wastes of advertising space are my friends’ stories, which, you’d think would be positioned at the top of my story feed, given that they are actually relevant to my life.  But they are not, go figure.

Going back to the camera function, I tried for almost ten minutes to figure out how add one of those adorable filters to my screen before learning that I had to tap on my face in selfie (aka default) mode.  Keep in mind that I was doing this all on my own, without a friend’s help.  This says to me that it is not a priority to anyone at Snapchat that a primary or popular function be intuitive to someone who is unfamiliar with the product.  That, to some experts, is considered bad design.

Once I finally figured out how to add a filter, I was sorely disappointed that the popular face-swap option was terrible at knowing where my mouth was, and would always place another person’s chin at my mouth-points. Weird. 

After finding a cartoon face that swapped properly, I sent my very first snap to my sister.  Hooray, I did it!  But my joy was immediately lost when I realized that Snapchat did not save my own photo, and I didn’t realize that I should have chosen to save it before sending in order to publish here.  It would have been awesome if Snapchat recognized that it was my first snap and prompted me that saving was an option, but it didn’t.  Bummer.

My sister, after getting my snap, sent one back to me with her and my niece using the adorable deer filter to put little deer ears and spots on their faces.  It was super cute!  But again, not realizing that Snapchat does not autosave any incoming snaps and that I could only view it once for about five seconds, it was lost forever. Sad.

She did, however, post a story earlier in the day that I was allowed to view over and over, and so I was able to take a screencap of that for my blog.  Hooray!

So my overall first impressions of Snapchat were not exactly positive.  I found it to have a frustrating learning curve, too much emphasis on unsolicited corporate or sponsored content and not enough on friends’ content, and a dumb default rear-facing camera setting to take selfies which I find fuels the rampant narcissism that plagues current social scenes.

The only upside I can see is using the fun filter options, especially during the presidential debates, which some of my friends appeared to do.  Unfortunately, I was still struggling with how Snapchat worked, so I guess I will have to wait until the final debate to have fun with that.
