title: Reflective Social Presence - Part III
---

As the weeks have gone by, I have had a lot of time to reflect on my usage of social media and what it means to me as an IRL person and as a virtual presence.  There were moments when it was important for me to disengage entirely from the public presence that social media forces upon us, and others where I felt a real need to have a voice.  And I have noticed that my experiences are not isolated.  Let me explain.

Several momentous and historic events have unfolded recently.  The first was somewhat localized to Chicago and to sports fans, with a not insignificant number of outliers: The Chicago Cubs baseball team won the World Series after a 108 year losing streak.  

To Chicago and many sports fans, this win meant so many things.  Whole generations have passed waiting to see the Cubs win, and they've had some loyal fans through and through despite their "Lovable Losers" title.  I mean, when it comes down to it, who doesn't root for the underdog?  The Cubs winning felt like a win for all the losers and underdogs of America.  It was truly empowering.

Throughout the rollercoaster that was the final Game 7, I saw many of my friends and family on Snapchat and Instagram posting reactions to the players and the plays.  But it wasn't until the end of the game, when the Cubs pulled a win out of extra innings, that my Snapchat and Instagram feeds started to blow up.  Shocked faces, champagne toasts, and revelrie in Wrigleyville were the themes of the night on most social media platforms it seemed.  It was a happy, beautiful thing.

The next morning I began watching some of the "sponsored" stories on Snapchat.  And, despite my initial hesitation to watch anything sponsered, I actually enjoyed the experience.  Watching crowds of people celebrate the Cubs historic win felt magical, like we all belonged to an enormous family that had just reunited.  These people were brothers and sisters and it was all love.
