title: Reflective Social Presence - Part III
---

As the weeks have gone by, I have had a lot of time to reflect on my usage of social media and what it means to me as an IRL person and as a virtual presence.  There were moments when it was important for me to disengage entirely from the public presence that social media forces upon us, and others where I felt a real need to have a voice.  And I have noticed that my experiences are not isolated.  Let me explain.

Several momentous and historic events have unfolded recently.  The first was somewhat localized to Chicago and to sports fans, with a not insignificant number of outliers: The Chicago Cubs baseball team won the World Series after a 108 year losing streak.  

To Chicago and many sports fans, this win meant so many things.  Whole generations have passed waiting to see the Cubs win, and they've had some loyal fans through and through despite their "Lovable Losers" title.  I mean, when it comes down to it, who doesn't root for the underdog?  The Cubs winning felt like a win for all the losers and underdogs of America.  It was truly empowering.

Throughout the rollercoaster that was the final Game 7, I saw many of my friends and family on Snapchat and Instagram posting reactions to the players and the plays.  But it wasn't until the end of the game, when the Cubs pulled a win out of extra innings, that my Snapchat and Instagram feeds started to blow up.  Shocked faces, champagne toasts, and revelrie in Wrigleyville were the themes of the night on most social media platforms it seemed.  Even I was sharing some pictures in an attempt to share my Chicagoan perspective with my family around the country.  It was a happy, beautiful thing.

The next morning I began watching some of the "sponsored" stories on Snapchat.  And, despite my initial hesitation to watch anything sponsered, I actually enjoyed the experience.  Watching crowds of people celebrate the Cubs historic win felt magical, like we all belonged to an enormous family that had just reunited.  These people were brothers and sisters and it was all love.

Contrast this with yesterday's historic loss for the potential first female President of the United States, and words or pictures can no longer express the feelings.  True, there is no joy, but there is also no sadness, no heartbreak, no feeling at all that I know how to convey to the world.  I posted no photos and saw none from my friends and family.  It was a desert of content.  But why?

Admittedly, I was not on text-based services like Facebook and Twitter, so there might be other perspectives of what happened last night.  But for image-based social media platforms like Snapchat and Instagram, pictures were clearly not expressive enough.  Which frankly, is interesting when you think about it.  They say a picture is worth a thousand words... does that mean that no picture equals no words?  Perhaps the shock and disappointment is so arresting, that since words cannot describe these emotions pictures are equally useless.

This morning, I woke up to another world.  One where images still held no place in the hearts of those I followed on Snapchat and Instagram.  Even my female muses were silent: no uplifting words or heartfelt condolences.  Maybe they were crying somewhere too.  Before I left the apartment to start my day, I decided to post my first "Story" on Snapchat.  It was going to be one that showed my helplessness, my disappointment.
