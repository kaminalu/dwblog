title: Reflective Social Presence - Part III
---

As the weeks have gone by, I have had a lot of time to reflect on my usage of social media and what it means to me as an IRL person and as a virtual presence.  There were moments when it was important for me to disengage entirely from the public presence that social media forces upon us, and others where I felt a real need to have a voice.  And I have noticed that my experiences are not isolated.  Let me explain.

Several momentous and historic events have unfolded recently.  The first was somewhat localized to Chicago and to sports fans, with a not insignificant number of outliers: The Chicago Cubs baseball team won the World Series after a 108 year losing streak.  

To Chicago and many sports fans, this win meant so many things.  Whole generations have passed waiting to see the Cubs win, and they've had some loyal fans through and through despite their "Lovable Losers" title.  I mean, when it comes down to it, who doesn't root for the underdog?  The Cubs winning felt like a win for all the losers and underdogs of America.  It was truly empowering.

Throughout the rollercoaster that was the final Game 7, I saw many of my friends and family on Snapchat and Instagram posting reactions to the players and the plays.  But it wasn't until the end of the game, when the Cubs pulled a win out of extra innings, that my Snapchat and Instagram feeds started to blow up.  Shocked faces, champagne toasts, and revelrie in Wrigleyville were the themes of the night on most social media platforms it seemed.  Even I was sharing some pictures in an attempt to share my Chicagoan perspective with my family around the country.  It was a happy, beautiful thing.

The next morning I began watching some of the "sponsored" stories on Snapchat.  And, despite my initial hesitation to watch anything sponsered, I actually enjoyed the experience.  Watching crowds of people celebrate the Cubs historic win felt magical, like we all belonged to an enormous family that had just reunited.  These people were brothers and sisters and it was all love.

Contrast this with yesterday's historic loss for the potential first female President of the United States, and words or pictures can no longer express the feelings.  True, there is no joy, but there is also no sadness, no heartbreak, no feeling at all that I know how to convey to the world.  I posted no photos and saw none from my friends and family.  It was a desert of content.  But why?

Admittedly, I was not on text-based services like Facebook and Twitter, so there might be other perspectives of what happened last night.  But for image-based social media platforms like Snapchat and Instagram, pictures were clearly not expressive enough.  Which frankly, is interesting when you think about it.  They say a picture is worth a thousand words... does that mean that no picture equals no words?  Perhaps the shock and disappointment is so arresting, that since words cannot describe these emotions pictures are equally useless.

This morning, I woke up to another world.  One where images still held no place in the hearts of those I followed on Snapchat and Instagram.  Even my female muses were silent: no uplifting words or heartfelt condolences.  Maybe they were crying somewhere too.  Before I left the apartment to start my day, I decided to post my first "Story" on Snapchat.  It was going to be one that showed my helplessness, disappointment, disbelief, and fear.

Now maybe this is a dramatic reaction to something that was almost completely out of my control.  I did my civic duty and voted.  That was all I could do.  But I still felt a supreme desire to express myself somewhere.  Why?

I don't think it came from a desire to show off my feelings or to tell everyone on some level who I voted for.  It was certainly not that shallow, and I don't use social media for those reasons.  If I really give thought to why I posted these things, I believe it came from a need for release.  

People have many opportunities to express themselves in their lives.  Some make art or music, some seek therapy and emotional bonds, others are violent or destructive.  There are an infinite number of ways to turn some real emotion into a vessel for catharsis, and this morning, I chose to post stuff on social media.  

That is not to say that I'm done.  The indescribable rollercoaster of emotions of the last week beg to be explored and expressed further.  And while some continue to slowly rely on text and images posted to social media, I will likely try new avenues that can reach deeper into my disappointment and fear and turn these feelings into something positve, into a chance to grow as a human being.

As for Snapchat, it has certainly served a purpose throughout these events.  Although my initial reacitons were frustration and an eagerness for this assignment to be over, I have found a new appreciation for what it can be: a massive community.  And I will likely continue to use it in some capacity into the future.  If for no other reason than to stay connected to those in my life who are my anchors to joy: my own little community.
