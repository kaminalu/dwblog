title: Digital Literacy Narrative - First Draft
---

In 1998, when I was 13 or 14 years old, I created my first email address. The handle I used was so ridiculous that I dare not even mention it to this day. However, the host I used, gURL.com also allowed me to create my own website using their interface. It was pretty limited to HTML markup and I started to learn the basics of the new language in an effort to build my very own webpage for the internet. To me, this was the coolest thing in the world, and I happily gave out my web address to all of my friends. At the time, it was nothing more than what we consider these days a “blog,” but it was my own little space on the web.  (NEED TO FLESH THIS OUT)

Now, as an adult, I’m am relearning what it feels like to write for the internet and build a space for myself among the billions of web pages that exist. My latest attempt has me using Jekyll, a static site generator that will allow me to build a blog using only the simplest of markdown text. While HTML still has immense usefulness (I built my professional website using it with CSS last semester), markdown with Jekyll is faster and more intuitive when creating a simple layout like a blog.

So far, the struggle in getting Jekyll to work has merely been using my Terminal in Linux to complete the installation of Ruby and Rails. Once that was done, I was able to install the Jekyll gem and create a new repository on github for my new blog for this class under “dwblog.” Writing new posts from there has been relatively easy, as all it required was reviewing the sample post the Jekyll dev team built, copying it with my own info and text within gedit, and pushing it to github.

I do, however, foresee some difficulty when I plan to implement a theme to my blog. Preliminary research has shown that I will need to do quite a bit of copying, deleting, downloading, pushing, and pulling of files, among probably other things. The prospect of what seems like should be a simple task has me a little worried, but I’m sure it will all look great in the end.
